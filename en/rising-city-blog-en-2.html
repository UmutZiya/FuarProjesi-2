                        <p>
                            The Rising City Building and Living Fair, organized by KFA Fair Organization, a subsidiary
                            of the Bursa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, significantly contributed to the business
                            volume of the real estate and construction sectors.
                            Held at the Bursa Fair Center, the fair hosted more than 15,000 local and international
                            visitors over four days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BTSO continues its efforts to make Bursa, Turkey's production and export hub, a center of
                            attraction in trade fairs. Led by BTSO, in collaboration with the Construction Contractors
                            Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association (İMSİAD) and the TMMOB Chamber of Architects
                            Bursa Branch, and organized by KFA Trade Fairs, the Rising City & Building and Life Fair
                            welcomed visitors from April 24-27 at the newly renovated Bursa Fair Center. After a long
                            hiatus, Bursa once again welcomed the excitement of trade fairs in the real estate and
                            construction sectors, with both exhibitors and visitors emphasizing the importance of the
                            fair as a vital part of the sector.

                        <h3 class="subtitle">"The Fair Strengthened the Sector"</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">BTSO Board Member Alparslan Şenocak stated that they aim to showcase Bursa's
                            potential in the construction and real estate sectors through the fair.

                            Şenocak emphasized that all the dynamics of the sector showed great interest in the fair,
                            saying, "We saw broad participation from our universities and academic chambers, from our
                            non-governmental organizations to the business world, and from our citizens. We aim to
                            further strengthen our fair in the coming period. We will continue to develop our fair with
                            a wider participation, companies that cater to a wider range of sectors, and different
                            concepts. The positive feedback we received this year, the enthusiasm of our companies for
                            the fair, and the excitement of the participants have given us hope for the future."</p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">“It Was a Good Start”</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">Ali Tuğcu, Chairman of the BTSO Construction Council, stated that the fair
                            attracted more attention than the sector expected, saying: “The construction industry is
                            rapidly affected by crises and takes time to recover. This fair made a really good start by
                            bringing together all the components in the sector. I believe that interest will continue to
                            increase in the coming years. All stakeholders in the sector were present. Furthermore, B2B
                            meetings were held simultaneously with the participation of foreign purchasing delegations.”
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">“Fair Participation Was Quite High”</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">İMSİAD President Şeref Demir stated that the fair, which was temporarily
                            suspended due to the pandemic, successfully brought together the industry and participants.
                            Demir said, “The fair saw high attendance. This event is of great importance for our
                            industry. This fair has been a beacon of hope for us in terms of developing technology, new
                            products, application methods, and establishing new communication networks. I believe our
                            fair will continue to grow stronger in the coming period. Furthermore, the fact that the
                            fair was organized by KFA Fair Organization added a special value. The new arrangements at
                            the fairgrounds also provided a spacious environment for the event. We thank BTSO for these
                            contributions.”</p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">“We are glad we attended the fair.”</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">BTSO Council Member Mustafa Altın stated that the fair exceeded expectations,
                            saying, "As with previous events, there was a large turnout. Participant feedback was also
                            quite positive. With the transfer of Bursa Fair Center to KFA Fair Organization, new
                            arrangements and venue planning at the fairgrounds added a unique atmosphere to the event.
                            The fact that it was held simultaneously with the Caravan Fair allowed the two fairs to
                            support each other. I'm so glad we attended."
                        </p>

                            the fair's contribution to the sector, saying, "This was a fair that the Bursa construction
                            sector had needed for a long time. As a company, we focused on energy performance. We
                            introduced our new products at this fair. Furthermore, thanks to the B2B meetings organized
                            by BTSO, we had the opportunity to expand into international markets. We established new
                            connections with the international guests. The fair exceeded our expectations. I believe the
                            fair will grow even stronger in the coming years. I would like to thank our BTSO President,
                            İbrahim Burkay."</p>

                            was revived. Overall, it was a busy and successful event. As a company, we introduced the

                            sales.”</p>

                            producing construction materials. This fair should be held annually. We are very pleased
                            with this year's organization. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope the fair will grow
                            and develop even more in the future." Fair participant Halil Bayam emphasized that the fair
